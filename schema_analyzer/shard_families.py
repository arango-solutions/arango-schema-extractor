"""Shard-family detection (PRD §6.2 bullet 5).

A *shard family* groups conceptual entities that share an identical
property set and a common name suffix — the structural fingerprint of
the per-source / per-repository / per-stream collection-duplication
pattern. The canonical example is::

    IBEX_Documents       → IBEXDocument
    MAROCCHINO_Documents → MAROCCHINODocument
    MOR1KX_Documents     → MOR1KXDocument
    OR1200_Documents     → OR1200Document

Four collections, four conceptual entities, *one* logical entity from a
consumer's perspective. Without family detection the LLM prompt builder
sees four entities, picks the first one alphabetically, and silently
narrows queries that should be fanning out across all four members.
That's defect D7 in ``arango-cypher-py/docs/schema_inference_bugfix_prd.md``.

This module is a deterministic, snapshot-only post-processor over
``data["physicalMapping"]["entities"]``. No DB round-trip, no LLM call.

Detection rules
---------------

1. **Bucket** entities by ``sha256(sorted(property_names))``. Skip
   buckets of size < ``MIN_SHARD_FAMILY_SIZE``.
2. Within each bucket, find the **longest common suffix** of the
   conceptual entity names that is at least
   ``MIN_SHARD_FAMILY_SUFFIX_LEN`` characters long and ends on a
   capital-letter boundary (the character just before the suffix in
   each name is lower-case, or the suffix is the entire name). Skip
   buckets with no qualifying suffix.
3. Extract the **prefix** of each member name (everything before the
   suffix). This is the per-member discriminator candidate.
4. **Probe for a discriminator field**: if every member entity declares
   a property whose name appears in
   ``SHARD_FAMILY_DISCRIMINATOR_FIELDS`` (case-insensitive),
   record ``discriminator.source = "field"`` and the field name.
   Otherwise record ``discriminator.source = "collection_prefix"`` and
   omit ``field``.
5. Emit one ``ShardFamily`` record per confirmed bucket. Families of
   one member are never emitted.

The output is a list (possibly empty) suitable for placement at
``data["physicalMapping"]["shardFamilies"]``. Empty lists are still
written so downstream consumers can tell "no families detected" apart
from "this analyzer build didn't run the detector" (the latter writes
nothing — see :func:`schema_analyzer.analyzer._apply_shard_families`).
