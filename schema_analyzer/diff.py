"""Structural diff between two analyses (PRD §3.13.3).

Consumers re-analyzing a database after a schema change need to know *what*
moved — which conceptual entities/relationships appeared or vanished, and which
physical mapping styles flipped (e.g. a concept that used to live in its own
collection now shares a generic collection with a type discriminator). This
module compares two ``AnalysisResult`` payloads (or their JSON dicts) and
returns a deterministic, JSON-safe diff.

It is intentionally schema-derived and side-effect free: no database, no LLM,
no clock. The OWL/Turtle exports of two analyses can be diffed by first running
each through the analyzer and diffing the results here.
