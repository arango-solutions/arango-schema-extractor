"""Sharding-pattern classification for the physical snapshot.

Closes the ``Sharding-pattern detection`` roadmap bullet added to
``docs/PRD.md`` §6.2 in commit ``b3d4744`` (2026-04-20). Emits a
``metadata.shardingProfile`` block that classifies the deployment
style once per analysis and carries the per-graph and per-collection
evidence downstream consumers (transpilers, NL→Cypher pipelines,
EXPLAIN-plan validators) need to reason about shard boundaries
without re-deriving the classification from raw snapshot fields.

Five exclusive styles are recognised, ordered most-to-least specific:

* ``OneShard`` — database-level ``sharding == "single"``. Every
  collection shares a shard; cross-collection traversal never
  crosses DBServers. Smart / disjoint graphs cannot coexist with
  OneShard by construction, so this classification wins outright
  when the database property is present.
* ``DisjointSmartGraph`` — at least one named graph has
  ``isSmart == true`` AND ``isDisjoint == true``. The canonical
  ArangoDB multi-tenant pattern: traversal across the disjoint
  attribute is forbidden at the storage layer.
* ``SmartGraph`` — at least one named graph has ``isSmart == true``
  but no graph is disjoint. Vertex collections share the smart
  attribute as their shard key; edge traversals are locality-aware.
* ``SatelliteGraph`` — every user collection in the snapshot has
  ``replicationFactor == "satellite"`` (or ``isSatellite == true``).
  Typical of meta-graph / ontology / reference-data databases where
  every collection is co-located with every shard of every other
  database that joins against it.
* ``Sharded`` (default) — none of the above; standard hash-sharded
  collections. The PRD's fall-through.

Classification is deterministic and snapshot-only. No additional DB
round-trip beyond what :func:`schema_analyzer.snapshot.snapshot_physical_schema`
already makes. Missing fields (older ArangoDB versions, restricted
users whose ``db.properties()`` call returned partial data) degrade
to ``Sharded`` with ``status == "degraded"`` and a human-readable
``statusReason``.

The module is a pure function over the snapshot dict; it has no
dependency on :mod:`schema_analyzer.analyzer` and is safe to import
from tests and from alternative tooling that builds the snapshot
independently.
